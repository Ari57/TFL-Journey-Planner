1. journey planner:

• Get starting and destination locations from user - done
• Return a list of all stop points with the location in their name - done
• Ask user to pick a starting/destination stop out of that list - done
• Those two stops will be used to return the journey steps - done
• Return the journey steps - done
• The starting/ending time for the journey is also displayed

2. display the status of the relevant trains

• There might be a key to indicate what train to take - done
• Need to figure out how to get all possible train lines, the index of the keys is a bit confusing - done
• Once we have all the train lines, we just need to list the statuses after all the train results are printed - done

Future improvements:

Use ICS code for more specific locations - should cause less errors
